# Polymarket Toolkits Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of Polymarket Toolkits pledge to make participation in our project and community a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the Polymarket community and users of the toolkit
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of inappropriate language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission (e.g. doxxing)
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or open-source setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (e.g. repository, issue tracker, discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project leadership.
